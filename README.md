# data structures & algorithms training

This is a growing collection of exercises to practice my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

## Running the tests

Test commands make use of some handy scripts so you don't have to navigate to directories. You can just use the exercise name.

### JavaScript

For example, to run the `merge-lists` exercise from the linked lists set, you can do:

```
yarn test merge-lists
```
